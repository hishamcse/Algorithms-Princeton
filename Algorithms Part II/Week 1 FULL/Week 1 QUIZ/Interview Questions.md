### Interview Questions: Undirected Graphs (ungraded)
TOTAL POINTS 3
##### Question 1
#### Nonrecursive depth-first search <br />
 Implement depth-first search in an undirected graph without using recursion <br /><br />

##### Question 2
#### Diameter and center of a tree. <br />
Given a connected graph with no cycles <br />

Diameter: design a linear-time algorithm to find the longest simple path in the graph. <br />
Center: design a linear-time algorithm to find a vertex such that its maximum distance from any other vertex is minimized. <br /><br />

##### Question 3
##### Euler cycle. <br />
 An Euler cycle in a graph is a cycle (not necessarily simple) that uses every edge in the graph exactly one. <br />

Show that a connected graph has an Euler cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree. <br />
Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a graph has an Euler cycle, and if so, find one. <br /><br /><br />


### Interview Questions: Directed Graphs (ungraded)
TOTAL POINTS 3
##### Question 1
#### Shortest directed cycle. <br />
Given a digraph G, design an efficient algorithm to find a directed cycle with the minimum number of edges (or report that the graph is acyclic). The running time of your algorithm should be at most proportional to V(E+V) and use space proportional to E + V, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. <br /><br />

##### Question 2
#### Hamiltonian path in a DAG. <br />
Given a directed acyclic graph, design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether it has a Hamiltonian path (a simple path that visits every vertex), and if so, find one. <br /><br />
 
##### Question 3
#### Reachable vertex. <br />
DAG: Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a DAG has a vertex that is reachable from every other vertex, and if so, find one. <br />
Digraph: Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a digraph has a vertex that is reachable from every other vertex, and if so, find one.
