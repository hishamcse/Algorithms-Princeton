<body><h3>ELEMENTARY SYMBOL TABLES</h3>

<p><br>


</p><p><b>Elementary implementations</b>.
Ordered array and linked list. Understand the performance of each.

</p><p><b>Comparable vs. equals</b>.
Keys must either be comparable or have an equals method which takes into account the semantics of the object. The default 
equals method only checks reference equality.

</p><p><b>API for Symbol Table and Ordered Symbol Table</b>.
Know the operations that go with symbol tables and ordered symbol tables. You don't have to be able to list them, but you 
should understand what they mean.

</p><p><b>Symbol table performance</b>.
Understand the performance of our elementary implementations.

</p><h3>Recommended Problems</h3>

<h4>C level</h4>

<h4>B level</h4>

<ol>

<li> In our elementary implementations, we considered ordered arrays and linked lists. We did not consider ordered linked lists. 
Why not?

</li><li> Give an example of something that you might like to store as a key in a symbol table for which there is no natural compare 
method.

</li><li>Do there exist any objects for which it is impossible to define a total order? In other words,
can we always write a compare method if we're willing to do the work, or are some data types
fundamentally impossible to compare other than for equality?

</li></ol>

<h4>A level</h4>
<ol><li>None available.
