### Interview Questions: Mergesort (ungraded)
TOTAL POINTS 3
##### Question 1
#### Merging with smaller auxiliary array. <br />
Suppose that the subarray a[0] to a[n−1] is sorted and the subarray a[n] to a[2∗n−1] is sorted. How can you merge the two subarrays so that a[0] to a[2∗n−1] is sorted using an auxiliary array of length n (instead of 2n)? <br /><br />

##### Question 2
#### Counting inversions. <br />
An inversion in an array a[] is a pair of entries a[i] and a[j] such that i < j but a[i] > a[j]. Given an array, design a linearithmic algorithm to count the number of inversions. <br /><br />

##### Question 3
##### Shuffling a linked list. <br />
Given a singly-linked list containing n items, rearrange the items uniformly at random. Your algorithm should consume a logarithmic (or constant) amount of extra memory and run in time proportional to nlogn in the worst case. <br /><br /><br />
