Interview Questions: Mergesort (ungraded)
TOTAL POINTS 3
1.Question 1
Merging with smaller auxiliary array. Suppose that the subarray \mathtt{a[0]}a[0] to \mathtt{a[n-1]}a[n−1] is sorted and the subarray \mathtt{a[n]}a[n] to \mathtt{a[2*n-1]}a[2∗n−1] is sorted. How can you merge the two subarrays so that \mathtt{a[0]}a[0] to \mathtt{a[2*n-1]}a[2∗n−1] is sorted using an auxiliary array of length nn (instead of 2n2n)?

2.Question 2
Counting inversions. An inversion in an array a[\,]a[] is a pair of entries a[i]a[i] and a[j]a[j] such that i < ji<j but a[i] > a[j]a[i]>a[j]. Given an array, design a linearithmic algorithm to count the number of inversions.

3.Question 3
Shuffling a linked list. Given a singly-linked list containing nn items, rearrange the items uniformly at random. Your algorithm should consume a logarithmic (or constant) amount of extra memory and run in time proportional to n \log nnlogn in the worst case.
